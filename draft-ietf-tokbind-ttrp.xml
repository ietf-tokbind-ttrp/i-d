        This document defines HTTP header fields that enable
        a TLS terminating reverse proxy to convey information to a backend server
        about the validated Token Binding Message
        received from a client, which enables that backend server to bind, or verify the binding
        of, cookies and other security tokens to the client's Token Binding key.

        <xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-https">Token Binding over HTTP</xref>
        provides a mechanism that enables HTTP
        servers to cryptographically bind cookies and other security tokens
        to a key held by the browser or other HTTP client,
        possession of which is proven on the <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> connections
        over which the tokens are used.
        When Token Binding is negotiated in the TLS handshake <xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-negotiation"/>
        the client sends an
        encoded Token Binding Message <xref target="I-D.ietf-tokbind-protocol"/>
        as a header in each HTTP request, which proves possession
        of one or more private keys held by the client. The public portion of the
        keys are represented in the Token Binding IDs of the Token Binding Message
        and for each one there is a signature over some data, which includes the exported keying material
        <xref target="RFC5705"/> of the TLS connection. An HTTP server issuing
        cookies or other security tokens can associate them with the Token Binding ID, which
        ensures those tokens cannot be used successfully over a different TLS connection
        or by a different client than the one to which they were issued.
      </t>
      <t>
        A fairly common deployment architecture for HTTPS applications is to have the backend HTTP application
        servers sit behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS. The proxy is accessible to the internet and
        dispatches client requests to the appropriate backend server within a private or protected network.
        The backend servers are not directly accessible outside the private network and are only reachable
        through the reverse proxy. The details of such deployments are typically opaque to clients
        who make requests to the proxy server and see responses as though they originated
        from the proxy server itself. TLS connections for HTTPS are established between
        each client and the reverse proxy server.
      </t>
      <t>
        Token Binding facilitates a binding of security tokens to a key held by the client by way of
        the TLS connection between that client and the server.

        In a deployment where TLS is terminated by a reverse proxy, however, the
        TLS connection is between the client and the proxy while the backend server is likely the
        system that will issue and validate cookies or other security tokens.

        Additional steps are therefore needed to enable the use of
        Token Binding in such deployment architectures. In the absence of a standardized approach,
        different implementations will address it differently, which will make interoperability
        between such implementations difficult or impossible without complex configurations or custom integrations.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document standardizes
        HTTP header field names that a
        TLS terminating reverse proxy (TTRP) adds to requests that it sends to the backend servers.
        The headers contain information from the validated Token Binding Message
        sent by the client to the proxy,
        thus enabling the backend server to bind, or verify the binding of,
        cookies and other security tokens to the client's Token Binding key.
        The usage of the
        headers, both the reverse proxy adding it and the application server using them to
        bind cookies or other tokens, are to be configuration options of the respective
        systems as they will not always be applicable.

      <t>
        The headers described herein enable a reverse proxy and backend server
        to function together as though they are single logical server side deployment of HTTPS Token Binding.
        Use of the headers outside that intended use case, however, may undermine the protections
        afforded by Token Binding. Therefore steps MUST be taken to prevent unintended use, both in
        sending the headers and in relying on their value.
      </t>
      <t>
        Producing and consuming the headers SHOULD be
        a configurable option, respectively, in a reverse proxy and backend server
        (or individual application in that server). The default configuration for both should be
        to not use the headers thus requiring an "opt-in" to the functionality.
      </t>
      <t>
        Backend servers MUST only accept the headers from trusted reverse proxies.
        And reverse proxies MUST sanitize the incoming request before forwarding it on
        by removing or overwriting any existing instances of the headers.
        Otherwise arbitrary clients can control the header values as seen
        and used by the backend server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The communication between a reverse proxy and backend server needs to be secured
        against eavesdropping and modification by unintended parties.
      </t>
      <t>
        The configuration options and request sanitization are necessarily functionally of the
        respective servers. The other requirements can be met in a number of ways, which
        will vary based on specific deployments. The communication between a reverse proxy and
        backend server, for example, might be over a mutually authenticated TLS with the
        insertion and consumption headers
        occurring only on that connection. Alternatively the network topology might
        dictate a private network such that the backend application is only able to accept requests
        from the reverse proxy and the proxy can only make requests to that server. Other
        deployments that meet the requirements set forth herein are also possible.
      </t>
